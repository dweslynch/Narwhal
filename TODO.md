# Roadmap

## Required Features

- Implement datatypes for a **model**, which is an ordered set of `Transform`s
- Implement logic for training a model from the MNIST dataset

## Improvements

- Implement more traditional matrix multiplication for transform layers and optimize for multicore

## Additonal Features

- Add generic models for different data sets and different types of input besides handwriting
